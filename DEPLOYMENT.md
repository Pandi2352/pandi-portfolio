## 1. Architecture Overview

Here's how the pieces fit together:

```
You (code) → GitHub (source code storage)
                ↓
          Cloudflare Pages (builds & hosts your site)
                ↓
          Cloudflare DNS (routes yourdomain.com to your site)
                ↑
          GoDaddy (you own the domain name here)
```

### Why these three services?

| Service | Role | Why we need it |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **GitHub** | Stores your source code | Cloudflare Pages pulls code from GitHub to build and deploy automatically. Every `git push` triggers a new deployment. |
| **GoDaddy** | Domain registrar | This is where you purchase and own your domain name (e.g., `pandiselvam.dev`). GoDaddy is just the "title deed" — it proves you own the name. |
| **Cloudflare** | DNS + Hosting + CDN + SSL | Cloudflare does the heavy lifting: it builds your Vite project, hosts the static files on a global CDN (250+ cities), provides free SSL certificates, and manages DNS so visitors reach your site. |

### Why not host directly on GoDaddy?

GoDaddy is a **domain registrar** — it sells domain names. While GoDaddy offers hosting, it is expensive, slow, and not optimized for static sites. Cloudflare Pages is **free**, faster (global CDN), and auto-deploys from GitHub.

### Why not just use GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages works but has limitations:
- No server-side redirects (problematic for SPAs with `react-router-dom`)
- Slower globally (served from a few locations vs Cloudflare's 250+ cities)
- Limited build customization
- 100 GB/month bandwidth limit

Cloudflare Pages gives you **unlimited bandwidth**, a global CDN, better SPA support, and more control — all for free.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [x] Your portfolio project working locally (`npm run dev` runs fine)
- [x] A GitHub account (yours: `Pandi2352`)
- [x] Your code pushed to GitHub (yours: `Pandi2352/pandi-portfolio`)
- [ ] A credit/debit card for purchasing a domain on GoDaddy
- [ ] A Cloudflare account (free — we'll create one)

---

## Step 1 — Push Your Code to GitHub

> **Why?** Cloudflare Pages needs access to your source code on GitHub. It pulls the code, runs `npm run build`, and deploys the output. Every future `git push` will automatically trigger a new deployment.

Your repo is already on GitHub at `https://github.com/Pandi2352/pandi-portfolio`. If you make changes locally, push them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Make sure `.gitignore` includes:

```
node_modules/
dist/
.env
```

> **Why .gitignore?** `node_modules/` is huge and gets recreated during build. `dist/` is generated by the build process. `.env` may contain secrets. None of these should be in your repo.

---

## Step 2 — Purchase a Domain on GoDaddy

> **Why GoDaddy?** GoDaddy is one of the largest and most beginner-friendly domain registrars. You're essentially buying the rights to a name on the internet (like `pandiselvam.dev` or `pandiselvam.com`).

### Steps:

1. Go to [https://www.godaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com)
2. Search for your desired domain name in the search bar
3. Pick a domain extension:

   | Extension | Best For | Price Range |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | `.com` | Universal, most recognized | ~$10-15/year |
   | `.dev` | Developers (enforces HTTPS) | ~$12-15/year |
   | `.in` | India-based professionals | ~$5-10/year |
   | `.io` | Tech/startups | ~$30-40/year |
   | `.me` | Personal portfolios | ~$10-20/year |

4. Add to cart and proceed to checkout
5. **IMPORTANT — Uncheck all add-ons:**
   - ❌ Domain Privacy (Cloudflare gives this free)
   - ❌ Email (not needed now)
   - ❌ Website Builder (we're using Cloudflare Pages)
   - ❌ SSL Certificate (Cloudflare gives this free)

6. Complete the purchase

> **Why buy only the domain?** GoDaddy upsells many services. We don't need any of them because Cloudflare provides DNS management, SSL, and privacy protection — all for free. Save your money.

### Tip: Choose a professional domain name
For a portfolio, `firstname-lastname.dev` or `firstnamelastname.com` looks clean and professional. Avoid numbers and hyphens if possible.

---

## Step 3 — Create a Cloudflare Account

> **Why Cloudflare?** Cloudflare is the backbone of our setup. It will act as our DNS manager (directing traffic), hosting platform (Cloudflare Pages), CDN (caching worldwide), and SSL provider (HTTPS encryption). All free.

### Steps:

1. Go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. Enter your email and create a password
3. Verify your email address
4. You'll land on the Cloudflare dashboard

> **What is Cloudflare?** Think of Cloudflare as a "middleman" between your visitors and your website. When someone types your domain, the request first hits Cloudflare. Cloudflare serves a cached version of your site from the nearest data center, making your site fast worldwide. It also blocks malicious traffic and provides HTTPS.

---

## Step 4 — Add Your Domain to Cloudflare

> **Why?** By adding your domain to Cloudflare, you're telling Cloudflare to manage all DNS records for your domain. DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phone book — it translates `yourdomain.com` into the actual server IP address where your site lives.

### Steps:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, click **"Add a site"** (or **"Add domain"**)
2. Enter your domain name (e.g., `pandiselvam.dev`) — without `www`
3. Select the **Free plan** and click **Continue**

   > **Why free plan?** The free plan includes everything we need: DNS management, SSL, CDN, and Cloudflare Pages. The paid plans add advanced features like WAF rules and analytics that a portfolio doesn't need.

4. Cloudflare will scan existing DNS records. Click **Continue** — we'll configure these later
5. Cloudflare will now show you **two nameservers** like:
   ```
   anya.ns.cloudflare.com
   bob.ns.cloudflare.com
   ```
6. **Copy both nameservers** — you'll need them in the next step

> **What are nameservers?** Nameservers are like the address of the phone book itself. When the internet wants to look up your domain, it first asks "which phone book (nameserver) has the records for this domain?" By pointing to Cloudflare's nameservers, you're saying "Cloudflare has my records."

---

## Step 5 — Change GoDaddy Nameservers to Cloudflare

> **Why?** This is the critical step that connects GoDaddy (where you own the domain) with Cloudflare (where you manage it). You're telling the entire internet: "For my domain, ask Cloudflare where to go."

### Steps:

1. Log in to [https://dcc.godaddy.com](https://dcc.godaddy.com) (GoDaddy Domain Control Center)
2. Click on your domain name
3. Scroll down to the **Nameservers** section
4. Click **"Change"** next to nameservers
5. Select **"Enter my own nameservers (advanced)"**
6. Delete the existing GoDaddy nameservers
7. Enter the two Cloudflare nameservers:
   ```
   anya.ns.cloudflare.com
   bob.ns.cloudflare.com
   ```
   *(Use your actual nameservers from Step 4 — these are examples)*
8. Click **Save**
9. Confirm the change when GoDaddy warns you

### Propagation Wait Time

> **Important:** Nameserver changes take **15 minutes to 48 hours** to propagate across the internet. Typically it takes **1-2 hours**. During this time, your domain might not resolve.

### How to Check Propagation

You can check if nameservers have updated:

```bash
# In terminal — check nameservers
nslookup -type=NS yourdomain.com

# Or use an online tool
# https://dnschecker.org
```

> **Why does propagation take time?** The internet has thousands of DNS servers worldwide, each caching domain records. When you change nameservers, each server needs to refresh its cache. This happens gradually as old cached records expire (based on TTL — Time To Live).

### Back in Cloudflare

Once propagation is complete:
1. Go back to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Click **"Check nameservers"**
3. Cloudflare will confirm: **"Great news! Cloudflare is now protecting your site"**

---

## Step 6 — Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

> **Why Cloudflare Pages?** This is the free hosting service where your portfolio actually lives. Cloudflare Pages connects to your GitHub repo, runs `npm run build` on every push, and serves the built files from its global CDN. Zero server management required.

### Steps:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **"Workers & Pages"** from the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create"**
3. Select the **"Pages"** tab
4. Click **"Connect to Git"**
5. Select **GitHub** and authorize Cloudflare to access your repos
6. Select your repository: **`Pandi2352/pandi-portfolio`**
7. Configure the build settings:

   | Setting | Value | Why |
   |---------|-------|-----|
   | **Project name** | `pandi-portfolio` | This becomes your `*.pages.dev` subdomain |
   | **Production branch** | `main` | Deploys when you push to `main` |
   | **Framework preset** | Select **"Vite"** | Auto-fills correct build settings for Vite |
   | **Build command** | `npm run build` | Runs `tsc -b && vite build` as defined in your `package.json` |
   | **Build output directory** | `dist` | Vite outputs built files to `dist/` folder |
   | **Root directory** | *(leave empty)* | Your project is at the repo root |
   | **Node.js version** | `18` or `20` | Under Environment Variables, add `NODE_VERSION` = `20` |

8. Under **Environment variables**, add:
   ```
   NODE_VERSION = 20
   ```

   > **Why set NODE_VERSION?** Cloudflare Pages defaults to an older Node.js version. Your project uses modern dependencies (Vite 7, React 19, TypeScript 5.9) that require Node.js 18+. Setting this ensures the build doesn't fail.

9. Click **"Save and Deploy"**
10. Wait for the first build to complete (usually 1-3 minutes)

### First Deploy Result

After the build succeeds, Cloudflare gives you a free URL like:
```
https://pandi-portfolio.pages.dev
```

**Visit this URL to verify your site works.** If it does, you're 70% done!

> **What happened behind the scenes?** Cloudflare cloned your GitHub repo, installed `node_modules` with `npm install`, ran `npm run build` (which compiles TypeScript and bundles everything with Vite), then took the `dist/` folder and distributed it across 250+ data centers worldwide.

---

## Step 7 — Connect Your Custom Domain to Cloudflare Pages

> **Why?** Right now your site works at `pandi-portfolio.pages.dev`. This step makes it accessible at your actual domain (e.g., `pandiselvam.dev`). Cloudflare will automatically create the necessary DNS records.

### Steps:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages**
2. Click on your **`pandi-portfolio`** project
3. Go to the **"Custom domains"** tab
4. Click **"Set up a custom domain"**
5. Enter your domain: `yourdomain.com`
6. Click **"Continue"**
7. Cloudflare will automatically add a **CNAME record** — click **"Activate domain"**
8. Repeat for `www.yourdomain.com` (so both `www` and non-`www` work)

### What DNS Records Cloudflare Creates

Cloudflare automatically adds:

```
Type    Name              Content                      Proxy
CNAME   yourdomain.com    pandi-portfolio.pages.dev    Proxied (orange cloud)
CNAME   www               pandi-portfolio.pages.dev    Proxied (orange cloud)
```

> **What is a CNAME record?** A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a DNS record that says "this domain is an alias for that other domain." So when someone visits `yourdomain.com`, DNS resolves it to `pandi-portfolio.pages.dev`, which Cloudflare then serves from its CDN.

> **What does "Proxied" (orange cloud) mean?** When proxied, traffic passes through Cloudflare's network. This enables CDN caching, SSL, DDoS protection, and performance optimization. If it's "DNS only" (grey cloud), traffic goes directly to the origin — bypassing all Cloudflare benefits.

---

## Step 8 — Configure SSL/HTTPS

> **Why?** SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts the connection between your visitor's browser and your website. Without SSL, browsers show a "Not Secure" warning, Google ranks you lower in search results, and data can be intercepted. Cloudflare provides SSL certificates for free.

### Steps:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, select your domain
2. Go to **SSL/TLS** from the left sidebar
3. Under **Overview**, set the encryption mode to **"Full (strict)"**

   > **Why "Full (strict)"?** This means encryption is enforced end-to-end. Cloudflare encrypts from the visitor to Cloudflare AND from Cloudflare to the origin (Pages). "Flexible" mode only encrypts the first half, which is less secure.

4. Go to **SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates**
5. Enable **"Always Use HTTPS"** — toggle it ON

   > **Why?** This automatically redirects anyone visiting `http://yourdomain.com` to `https://yourdomain.com`. Without this, people could accidentally access the insecure version.

6. Enable **"Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"** — toggle it ON

   > **Why?** If your site has any mixed content (loading a resource over `http://` while the page is `https://`), this automatically fixes those URLs to use HTTPS. Prevents "mixed content" browser warnings.

7. Scroll down and ensure **"HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)"** is enabled
   - Click **"Enable HSTS"**
   - Set Max-Age to **6 months** or **1 year**
   - Enable **"Include subdomains"**
   - Enable **"No-Sniff Header"**
   - Click **Save**

   > **Why HSTS?** HSTS tells browsers: "Only ever connect to this site over HTTPS. Even if someone types `http://`, go to `https://` directly without even trying HTTP first." This prevents SSL-stripping attacks and speeds up subsequent visits.

---

## Step 9 — Configure Cloudflare Performance Settings

> **Why?** These settings make your portfolio load faster for visitors worldwide. A fast site improves user experience and Google search ranking.

### 9a. Caching

1. Go to **Caching → Configuration**
2. Set **Browser Cache TTL** to **1 month**

   > **Why?** This tells visitors' browsers to cache static assets (CSS, JS, images) for 1 month. When they revisit your site, these files load instantly from their local cache instead of being re-downloaded.

### 9b. Speed Optimizations

1. Go to **Speed → Optimization**
2. Enable **Auto Minify** for JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

   > **Why?** Minification removes whitespace, comments, and shortens variable names in your code. This reduces file sizes, meaning faster downloads. Vite already minifies, but this is an extra layer.

3. Enable **Brotli** compression

   > **Why?** Brotli is a modern compression algorithm (better than gzip). It compresses your files before sending them to visitors, reducing transfer sizes by 15-25% compared to gzip.

### 9c. Page Rules (Optional — www redirect)

To redirect `www.yourdomain.com` to `yourdomain.com` (or vice versa):

1. Go to **Rules → Page Rules**
2. Click **"Create Page Rule"**
3. URL: `www.yourdomain.com/*`
4. Setting: **Forwarding URL** — **301 (Permanent Redirect)**
5. Destination: `https://yourdomain.com/$1`
6. Save

> **Why redirect www?** Having both `www.yourdomain.com` and `yourdomain.com` serving the same site creates duplicate content for search engines. A 301 redirect consolidates them into one canonical URL, which is better for SEO.

---

## Step 10 — Handle SPA Routing (React Router)

> **Why?** Your portfolio uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing. When someone visits `yourdomain.com/about` directly (or refreshes on that page), the server looks for a file called `/about/index.html` — which doesn't exist. Only `index.html` exists at the root. We need to tell Cloudflare to serve `index.html` for all routes, then React Router handles the routing in the browser.

### Create `_redirects` file

Create a file at `public/_redirects` in your project:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

> **What does this do?** This tells Cloudflare Pages: "For any URL path (`/*`), serve `/index.html` with a 200 status code." This way, React Router receives the request and shows the correct page.

> **Why in `public/`?** Files in the `public/` directory are copied as-is to the `dist/` folder during build. Vite doesn't process them — they're served directly.

### Alternative: `_headers` file (optional)

You can also create `public/_headers` for custom headers:

```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

> **Why these headers?**
> - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — prevents your site from being embedded in iframes (clickjacking protection)
> - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents browsers from guessing file types (MIME sniffing attacks)
> - `Referrer-Policy` — controls how much referrer info is shared when navigating away
> - `Permissions-Policy` — blocks access to camera, microphone, and location (your portfolio doesn't need these)

### Push These Files

```bash
git add public/_redirects public/_headers
git commit -m "add Cloudflare Pages routing and security headers"
git push origin main
```

Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy.

---

## Step 11 — Verify Everything Works

> **Why?** Always verify after deployment. Things can break silently — DNS misconfiguration, build failures, routing issues. Catching them now saves embarrassment later.

### Checklist

Run through this checklist after deployment:

```
[ ] https://yourdomain.com loads correctly
[ ] https://www.yourdomain.com redirects to https://yourdomain.com
[ ] http://yourdomain.com redirects to https://yourdomain.com
[ ] All pages/routes work (click through your navigation)
[ ] Refresh on a sub-route (e.g., /about) doesn't show 404
[ ] Images and assets load correctly
[ ] Animations (Framer Motion) work
[ ] Site loads on mobile
[ ] SSL padlock icon shows in the browser address bar
```

### Test Tools

| Tool | URL | What It Tests |
|------|-----|---------------|
| **SSL Check** | https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ | SSL certificate validity |
| **DNS Check** | https://dnschecker.org | DNS propagation worldwide |
| **Speed Test** | https://pagespeed.web.dev | Performance score |
| **Headers Check** | https://securityheaders.com | Security headers |

### Test from Terminal

```bash
# Check if domain resolves
nslookup yourdomain.com

# Check SSL certificate
curl -vI https://yourdomain.com 2>&1 | grep "subject:"

# Check redirect (http → https)
curl -I http://yourdomain.com

# Check www redirect
curl -I https://www.yourdomain.com
```

---

## Updating Your Site

> Every time you push code to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys. No manual steps needed.

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code locally
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Build locally to verify no errors
npm run build

# 4. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "update portfolio"
git push origin main

# 5. Cloudflare Pages automatically deploys (1-3 minutes)
```

### Monitor Deployments

1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → your project
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. You'll see every deployment with status (success/fail), timestamp, and commit hash
4. Each deployment gets a unique preview URL (e.g., `abc123.pandi-portfolio.pages.dev`)

> **Why preview URLs?** Every deployment (even from non-main branches) gets its own URL. This lets you test changes before merging to `main`. Push to a feature branch, get a preview URL, verify it looks good, then merge.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Cloudflare Pages

**Symptoms:** Deployment shows "Failed" in the Cloudflare dashboard.

**Fix:**
1. Click on the failed deployment to see build logs
2. Common issues:
   - **Node version too old** → Add `NODE_VERSION = 20` in environment variables
   - **Missing dependencies** → Make sure `package.json` has all dependencies (not just devDependencies)
   - **TypeScript errors** → Run `npm run build` locally to catch errors before pushing

### Domain Shows "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"

**Symptoms:** Browser says the domain doesn't exist.

**Why:** Nameservers haven't propagated yet.

**Fix:** Wait 1-48 hours. Check propagation at https://dnschecker.org.

### Site Loads but Shows Blank White Page

**Symptoms:** HTML loads but nothing renders.

**Why:** JavaScript files are not loading — usually a path issue.

**Fix:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab → look for errors
2. Check if `vite.config.ts` has a `base` property — it should NOT have one for custom domain deployment (remove `base: '/pandi-portfolio/'` if present)
3. Redeploy

### 404 on Page Refresh

**Symptoms:** Direct URL or refresh on `/about` shows 404.

**Why:** Missing `_redirects` file.

**Fix:** Create `public/_redirects` with content `/*    /index.html   200` and redeploy.

### "Too Many Redirects" Error

**Symptoms:** Browser shows ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS.

**Why:** SSL mode conflict. Usually happens when SSL is set to "Flexible" but the origin forces HTTPS.

**Fix:** In Cloudflare → SSL/TLS → set mode to **"Full (strict)"**.

### Old Version Still Showing After Deploy

**Symptoms:** You deployed new code but the old version still appears.

**Why:** Browser cache or Cloudflare cache.

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. In Cloudflare → Caching → Configuration → click **"Purge Everything"**
